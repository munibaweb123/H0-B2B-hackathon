# Project

## Scenario: Hackathon
**Duration:** Hours to 1 day
**Priority:** Ship a working demo. Speed over perfection.

---

## Working Mode
Before making any technical decision (database, framework, pattern, library, architecture choice),
present 2-3 options with one-line trade-offs and wait for confirmation before implementing.
Never pick a stack component without asking first.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (built with Claude Code, deployed on Vercel — v0.dev not required)
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (`uv init backend --package`), built with Claude Code
- **AI Framework:** OpenAI Agents SDK (`openai-agents`) with OpenAI key
- **Database:** Amazon Aurora DSQL (serverless, PostgreSQL-compatible, IAM auth via boto3)
- **Voice Transcription:** OpenAI Whisper API (same key, supports Urdu, ~$0.006/min)
- **WhatsApp:** Meta Business API — testing credentials (sandbox, sufficient for demo)
- **Email:** Resend (free tier, 100 emails/day, Python SDK)
- **Location Auto-fill:** Google Places API (free $200/month credit, ~200 requests for hackathon)
- **Site Visit Booking:** In-app slot picker (no external calendar integration needed for demo)
- **Web Search:** Tavily API (plugged in as an OpenAI Agents SDK tool)

## Conventions

### Established in Phase 01 — Foundation

**Folder structure**
```
backend/src/backend/
├── core/       # config, database, auth
├── models/     # SQLModel table classes
├── routers/    # FastAPI route handlers (thin — call services)
├── schemas/    # Pydantic request/response models
└── main.py     # App entry point, lifespan, middleware
```

**Patterns**
- All models inherit `SQLModel, table=True` — no raw SQLAlchemy models
- Every model has `tenant_id: UUID` — no exceptions
- Routers are thin: they validate input, call a service or query directly, return response
- `get_session` and `get_current_user` are FastAPI dependencies injected into every protected router
- All secrets loaded via `Settings` (pydantic-settings) from `.env` at project root
- `uv run uvicorn backend.main:app` is the server start command, run from `backend/` directory

**Do not:**
- Mix raw SQLAlchemy with SQLModel
- Hardcode any secret or config value
- Use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` — asyncpg expects naive datetimes, use `datetime.utcnow()`
- Use `passlib` — incompatible with bcrypt 4.x; use `bcrypt` directly

**Password hashing**
Use `bcrypt.hashpw` / `bcrypt.checkpw` directly (passlib removed due to bcrypt 4.x incompatibility)

**WhatsApp**
Using `pywa` library. Credentials: access token, verify token, app ID/secret, phone number ID, business account ID, callback URL, API version — all in `.env`

### Established in Phase 02 — Core CRM

**Folder structure additions**
```
backend/src/backend/
└── services/   # Business logic layer — routers call services, never write DB logic in routers
```

**Aurora DSQL constraints (do not violate — these will crash DDL)**
- No `CREATE TYPE ... AS ENUM` → all enum fields use `sa_column=Column(String)`
- No `CREATE INDEX` (sync) → never use `index=True` on any field
- No `UNIQUE` constraints → never use `unique=True`; enforce uniqueness in application code
- No `FOREIGN KEY` constraints → never use `foreign_key=` in Field(); enforce in service layer
- No multiple DDL in one transaction → `create_tables()` creates each table in its own `engine.begin()`
- `checkfirst=True` is extremely slow on DSQL (~4s per table) — use try/except "already exists" instead

**Aurora DSQL connection**
- IAM token via `boto3.client("dsql").generate_db_connect_admin_auth_token()`
- First boto3 call takes ~22s (SDK init) — pre-warmed in `init_db()` before server accepts traffic
- Token cached in `_token_cache` dict with 900s lifetime; refreshed 60s before expiry
- `_dsql_client` is a module-level singleton — do not recreate per request
- Connection string: `postgresql+asyncpg://admin@<endpoint>:5432/postgres` with `ssl=True`
- `pool_recycle=800` ensures connections are recycled before the 900s token expires
- `do_connect` SQLAlchemy event injects cached token as password on each new connection

**`create_tables()` vs `init_db()`**
- `create_tables()` — one-time first-deploy function; run manually, not on server startup
- `init_db()` — called on every startup; only verifies connectivity (SELECT 1) after pre-warming token

**Services pattern**
- All DB logic lives in `services/<entity>_service.py`
- Services raise `HTTPException` directly (no re-wrapping in routers)
- `tenant_id` always comes from `get_current_user`, never from request body
- Returning 404 (not 403) when a record exists under a different tenant — never leak existence

**Stage transitions**
- `STAGE_ORDER` list in `models/client.py` defines legal order
- Transition valid only if `new_idx == current_idx + 1` — no skipping, no going backward
- Validation lives in `client_service.update_stage()`, not in the router

### Established in Phase 03 — AI Agent

**Folder structure additions**
```
backend/src/backend/
└── ai/         # AI layer — agent definition, tools, router (isolated from routers/ and services/)
```

**OpenAI Agents SDK patterns**
- Single `propflow_agent` (gpt-4o) with all tools registered; `_direct_agent` (no tools) for match/draft-followup where all data is passed in prompt
- Tools use `RunContextWrapper[AgentContext]` — context (tenant_id, session, language) injected per request via `Runner.run(..., context=AgentContext(...))`; LLM cannot forge tenant_id
- Agent instructions are a callable `_build_instructions(ctx, agent) -> str` — language instruction injected dynamically based on `ctx.context.language`
- `Runner.run()` (not stream) for all calls — no streaming
- All AI endpoints catch OpenAI errors and return 503 (never let auth/quota errors bubble as 500)

**Language detection**
- `detect_language(text)` in `ai/agent.py` — checks Unicode range `؀`–`ۿ` (U+0600–U+06FF)
- Call before `Runner.run()` and set `AgentContext.language` — do not ask the LLM to detect language

**Tavily web search**
- Wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=5.0)` — always returns gracefully even on timeout
- If `TAVILY_API_KEY` is empty, tool returns a "not configured" string; agent continues without crashing
- Import `TavilyClient` inside the tool function — not at module level (optional dependency)

**Pinned versions (do not upgrade during hackathon)**
- `openai-agents==0.17.7` (installed as `openai-agents>=0.0.19`)
- `tavily-python==0.7.26` (installed as `tavily-python>=0.5.0`)

**AI endpoints contract (downstream phases must not break)**
- `POST /ai/chat` → `{reply: str, tool_calls_made: [str]}`
- `POST /ai/match/{client_id}` → `{client_id: str, matches: [{property_id, score, reason}]}`
- `POST /ai/draft-followup/{client_id}` → `{message_text: str, channel: str}`
- `POST /ai/search` → `{results: [dict], summary: str}`

### Established in Phase 04 — Integrations

**Folder structure additions**
```
backend/src/backend/
└── integrations/   # External-world connectors — WhatsApp, Whisper, Places, email, deal closer, slots
```

**WhatsApp integration (no pywa — direct Meta Graph API via httpx)**
- `send_whatsapp(to, message)` — async httpx POST to Meta Graph API; silently no-ops if credentials absent
- `verify_signature(payload, signature)` — HMAC-SHA256 against `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`; skip verification if secret empty (dev mode)
- Webhook handler has no authenticated user — uses first agency in DB as demo tenant; for multi-tenant production, look up agency by `phone_number_id`
- pywa was NOT used — direct httpx calls are simpler and fully async

**Whisper transcription**
- `transcribe_voice_note(media_id)` — two-step: GET Meta media URL (Bearer token), download audio bytes, POST to `openai.audio.transcriptions` with `model="whisper-1"`
- Audio format passed as `("audio.ogg", io.BytesIO(bytes), "audio/ogg")` — Whisper accepts OGG/Opus from WhatsApp natively

**Autonomous deal closer pattern**
- POST /deal-closer/{property_id} — synchronous, inline, no background tasks
- Filter: `budget_max >= price × 0.85` AND city substring match AND `bedrooms_needed == bedrooms` (None = any)
- Pitches generated concurrently with `asyncio.gather()` using `_direct_agent` from Phase 03
- Each pitch logged as `InteractionType.whatsapp` via `interaction_service.log_interaction()`

**Resend email**
- `resend.Emails.send()` is sync — always wrap in `asyncio.to_thread()`
- Sender address: `"PropFlow <onboarding@resend.dev>"` (Resend sandbox domain for testing)
- Returns `{sent: false, reason: "..."}` (not 500) when key absent or send fails

**Google Places proxy**
- `GET /places/autocomplete?input=<text>` — passes `components=country:pk` to restrict to Pakistan
- Falls back to `[]` (not error) when `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is absent

**SiteVisitSlot model**
- Fields: `id, tenant_id, agent_id, slot_datetime, is_booked (bool), booked_by_client_id (Optional[UUID]), created_at`
- `is_booked` stored as native boolean — Aurora DSQL supports Boolean without special handling
- Double-booking returns **409** (not 400) — downstream must handle 409 specifically

**Pinned versions (do not upgrade)**
- `httpx==0.28.1`
- `resend==2.32.2`

---

## Constraints
- Hackathon build — hours to 1 day, demo must work end-to-end
- Multi-tenant: each agency's data is fully isolated
- WhatsApp integration via Meta Business API (assumed access in place)
- AI replies in same language as input; Urdu script → Roman Urdu reply
- Location auto-fill required on all property and client forms
- No payment/billing system, no mobile app, no raw scraping

---

## Product Requirements

### Core Features (In Scope)
1. Agency workspace & team management (multi-tenant, isolated)
2. Property listings management (CRUD + photo + location auto-fill)
3. Client management (profile, requirements, interaction history)
4. AI property matching (auto-rank listings against client requirements)
5. Sales pipeline — Kanban: New Lead → Contacted → Site Visit → Negotiation → Closed
6. Automated follow-up messages (AI-written, WhatsApp + email, agent reviews before sending)
7. Autonomous deal closer (new listing → AI pitches matched clients → books site visit → notifies agent)
8. AI chat interface (conversational access to all agency data and actions)
9. WhatsApp as primary interface (forward messages/voice notes → PropFlow acts)
10. Voice note understanding (transcribe + extract client requirements)
11. Multilingual AI — English in → English out; Urdu script in → Roman Urdu out; voice note → Roman Urdu
12. Email automation (AI-written, triggered post-visit / no-contact / new match)
13. Agency dashboard (listings count, active clients, pipeline value, deals closed)
14. Location auto-fill (suggest Pakistani housing societies and cities as agent types)
15. Smart natural language search ("3-bed DHA Lahore under 80 lakh" → filtered results)

### Optional / Stretch (Build if time allows)
16. AI web search via Tavily (hunt matching properties on Zameen, OLX in real time)
17. Deal probability score (engagement-based likelihood to close this week)

### Out of Scope
- Raw web scraping bots
- Urdu real-time voice input (speech-to-text fine-tuned model)
- Payment & billing
- Mobile application

---

## User Flows

### Agency Onboarding
Sign up → workspace created → invite team members → assign roles

### Property Listing
Agent adds property → fills details + location auto-fill + photos → listed instantly

### Client Intake
Agent adds client → saves requirements → AI immediately shows ranked matching properties

### Autonomous Deal Close
New property listed → AI identifies matched clients → sends personalized WhatsApp pitches → client replies interest → AI offers visit slots → client picks slot → agent calendar updated → agent shows up

### WhatsApp Flow
Agent forwards client message/voice note to PropFlow WhatsApp → AI reads/transcribes → creates/updates client profile → agent continues on WhatsApp

### AI Chat
Agent opens chat → types question in English or Urdu → PropFlow answers based on agency's own data → agent takes action

---

## Success Criteria
- Live demo works end-to-end (at least: add property → AI matches clients → sends WhatsApp pitch)
- AI chat responds accurately using agency data
- Multi-tenant isolation verifiable
- Dashboard shows real numbers from seeded data
- Judges can see autonomous deal closer fire in real time

### Established in Phase FE-01 — Frontend Foundation

**Folder structure**
```
frontend/src/
├── app/

    ├── auth.tsx    # AuthProvider + useAuth() hook
    └── utils.ts    # cn() helper (clsx + tailwind-merge)
```

**Pinned versions (do not upgrade)**
- `next`: `14.2.35`
- `tailwindcss`: `^3.4.1` (Tailwind v3 — Shadcn/ui 2.x targets v3, NOT v4)
- `shadcn`: `4.12.0` (components generated with `style: "default"`)

**Design tokens (tailwind.config.ts)**
- `maroon.dark` `#33063C` / `maroon.medium` `#5C1169` / `maroon.light` `#7d4c84`
- `cream` `#fdf9ed` / `cream.card` `#fef9ee`
- `blush` `#e8a8b4` / `pink.accent` `#d4636b` / `gold` `#c9a84c`
- `text.primary` `#1a1a1a` / `text.muted` `#6b7280`
- Fonts: `font-serif` → Playfair Display, `font-sans` → DM Sans (via `next/font/google`)

**Auth pattern**
- JWT stored in `localStorage` under key `propflow_token`
- Auth redirect is client-side only (localStorage unreadable in middleware) — `(app)/layout.tsx` calls `useAuth()` and does `router.replace('/login')` if no user after load
- `middleware.ts` exists as a stub for future cookie-based upgrades; it currently passes all requests through

**API client**
- `apiFetch` reads token from localStorage, prepends `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, throws `ApiError` on non-2xx
- All typed helpers re-export from `@/lib/api`

**WSL2 / NTFS constraint**
- `npm install` and `npx shadcn` fail with `EPERM chmod` on `/mnt/d/` paths
- Workaround: `node_modules` is a symlink → `/home/munibapc/.npm-modules/propflow-frontend` (Linux ext4)
- All npm/npx commands must be run from WSL terminal pointed at `/mnt/d/quarter-5/H0-B2B-hackathon/frontend/`
- Do **not** add `node_modules` to git or copy it to Windows filesystem

**Dev server**
- Start: `npm run dev` from `frontend/` directory
- Env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` in `frontend/.env.local`

---

### Established in Phase FE-02 — Auth Screens

**Layout pattern for auth pages**
- `(auth)/layout.tsx` provides only `min-h-screen bg-cream` — no centering, no max-width constraint
- Individual pages own their own layout (split or centered) — do not add centering to the shared layout

**Split layout (login + signup)**
- Two-column flex: left = form on `bg-cream`, right = hero panel on `bg-maroon-dark` (`hidden lg:flex`)
- Each column is `flex-1`; hero panel is hidden on mobile
- Form column: `px-8 py-12 lg:px-16`, contains `max-w-md` wrapper for the form content
- Hero panel: white text, `font-serif` headline, stats grid or testimonial card with `bg-maroon-medium/30` border

**Centered card (invite page)**
- Page handles its own centering: `flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-cream`
- Card: `max-w-md rounded-2xl border border-maroon-light/20 bg-white p-10 shadow-lg`

**Auth page conventions**
- All auth pages are `'use client'` — need `useRouter` and `useAuth`
- Single object `useState` for form fields — no per-field state splits
- Inline validation errors: `<p className="text-sm text-pink-accent">` below each field
- Submit error: same `<p className="text-sm text-pink-accent">` above the submit button
- Never write to `localStorage` in page components — always call `useAuth().login(token)`
- Call `login(token)` then immediately `router.push("/dashboard")` — never push before login
- Authenticated user redirect: `useEffect(() => { if (user) router.replace("/dashboard") }, [router, user])`

**Backend field names for auth endpoints**
- `POST /auth/signup` → `{ agency_name, full_name, email, password }`
- `POST /auth/accept-invite` → `{ token, full_name, password }` (spec note saying `name` was wrong — backend uses `full_name`)

---

### Established in Phase FE-03 — Dashboard & Properties

**Shared types**
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts` — `PropertyResponse`, `ClientResponse`, `DashboardStats`, `formatPKR()`, `STAGE_LABELS`, `STAGE_COLORS`
- All frontend phases import shared interfaces from `@/types` — do not re-declare them in page files

**PKR currency formatting**
- `formatPKR(amount: number)` in `src/types/index.ts` — renders `Rs X Cr` (≥1Cr), `Rs X Lac` (≥1Lac), or raw commas
- Never use raw number display for monetary values — always pass through `formatPKR`

**Dashboard data pattern**
- Dashboard page calls two independent endpoints: `GET /dashboard` (stat cards) + `GET /clients` (pipeline counts + recent activity)
- Pipeline distribution computed client-side from `ClientResponse[]` — no dedicated endpoint exists
- `GET /dashboard` returns `{ total_properties, active_clients, pipeline_value, deals_closed }` — no stage breakdown

**Deal Closer response shape (actual, not spec)**
- `POST /deal-closer/{id}` returns `{ property_id: str, clients_pitched: [{ client_id, name, message_preview }] }`
- Spec said `{ pitched, visits_booked }` — that was wrong; use `clients_pitched.length` for the count shown in toast
- No visits_booked field exists in response

**PropertyForm pattern**
- Single component handles both add (`id = undefined`) and edit (`id = UUID`) — distinguished by `id` prop presence
- Photo URLs entered as newline-separated textarea, split on `\n` and filtered before sending `photos: string[]`
- Location autocomplete (`LocationInput`) is an inline component in `PropertyForm.tsx` — `useState` + `useRef` debounce, no library
- `onBlur` closes dropdown with 150ms delay to allow `onMouseDown` to fire before blur clears suggestions

**Filters**
- All property filters (city, type, status, bedrooms, price) are client-side `useState` — no re-fetch on change
- `bedrooms === "5+"` maps to `p.bedrooms >= 5` check

**Skeleton loading**
- Use per-card `<Skeleton>` (not full-page spinner) on all data-fetching pages — import from `@/components/ui/skeleton`

---

### Established in Phase FE-04 / FE-05 — Layout, AI Chat & Integrations

**AppLayout is applied ONCE by the route group layout (critical)**
- `(app)/layout.tsx` wraps every child in `<AppLayout>` — individual pages must **never** import or wrap themselves in `<AppLayout>`, or the sidebar + topnav render twice
- Pages return their content directly (a `<div>` or `<>` fragment) — fixed retroactively in `clients/`, `clients/[id]/`, `clients/new/`, `pipeline/`

**Route paths (sidebar is source of truth, not the phase spec)**
- AI Chat lives at `/ai-chat` (spec said `/ai/chat`); Site Visits at `/site-visits` (spec said `/slots`) — use the sidebar paths so navigation links resolve

**AI Chat page**
- Full-height escape from AppLayout's `p-6`: wrap in `<div className="-m-6 flex h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]">`
- `messages: ChatMessageType[]` in `useState`, no persistence; history sent to `POST /ai/chat` as `{ message, history: [{role, content}] }` — strip `tool_calls` before sending
- Enter submits, Shift+Enter newlines; typing indicator = 3 `animate-bounce` dots while `loading`
- `.hide-scrollbar` utility lives in `globals.css` (not `<style jsx>` — unsupported in App Router pages)

**Slots / Site Visits**
- Slot datetime sent as naive ISO string `"${date}T${time}:00"` (no timezone) to match Aurora DSQL `datetime.utcnow()`
- `parseLocalDate()` in `WeekCalendar.tsx` manually parses the naive string into a local `Date` — never `new Date(str)` (would apply UTC shift)
- Booking catches `ApiError.status === 409` explicitly → "Slot already booked — please choose another"

**Settings page**
- `GET /agency/agents` does NOT exist in backend — settings shows current user only (`GET /auth/me`) with an "Invite agents to see them here" note
- Invite → `POST /auth/invite` with `{ email }`

**Backend: OpenAI key must be registered with the Agents SDK explicitly**
- `pydantic-settings` loads `.env` into the `settings` object but **not** into `os.environ` — the OpenAI Agents SDK's env-var lookup finds nothing and raises "Missing credentials"
- Fix: `set_default_openai_key(settings.OPENAI_API_KEY)` at import time in `ai/agent.py`

**Backend: Aurora DSQL SSL**
- `connect_args={"ssl": "require"}` (NOT `ssl=True`) — `True` makes asyncpg hang on cert verification and times out on connect

**New shared types (`src/types/index.ts`)**
- `SlotResponse`, `UserResponse`, `ChatMessageType` added — import from `@/types`, do not re-declare
